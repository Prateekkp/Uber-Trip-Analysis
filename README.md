## 🗂️ Data Overview

| Table Name             | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Uber Trip Details.xlsx`    | Contains booking ID, trip time, fare, vehicle ID, etc. |
| `Location Details.xlsx`| Includes location IDs and corresponding names     |

**Data Modeling Approach:**

- `Location ID` linked to **Pickup Point** (Active Relationship)
- `Drop-off Point` managed via **USERELATIONSHIP** in DAX (Inactive Relationship)
- A custom **Calendar Table** was built to support time-based analysis

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Uber Pay** is the most preferred payment method, dominated by **UberX** usage
- **Penn Station** is the most frequent pickup and **Upper East Side North** is most frequent drop-off point
- **Peak demand occurs from 12 PM to 6 PM**, especially on **weekends**
- With vehicle inventory data, **supply-demand optimization** would have been possible
